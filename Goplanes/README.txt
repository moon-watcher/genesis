Great plane game on Genesis, unfortunately it doesn't compile.
For now it doesn't compile...
It need genres from here : http://gendev.spritesmind.net/page-genres.html
Which need windows, but it may be possible to use it on linux who know... 
Here is the source code of genres : https://bitbucket.org/SpritesMind/genres/downloads
